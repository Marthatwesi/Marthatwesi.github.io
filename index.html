        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="column">
            <p>I am a personal self-starter and an ambitious leader committed to the success of the teams I lead through the fostering of harmony, synergistic collaboration and consistent motivation. I also consider myself  aptly attuned to the concerns of the communities in which I live and/or work and this trait influences the projects I am earnestly passionate about. I am particularly interested in improving the welfare of vulnerable women and children. I am sincere, easy-going with a calm temperament. This makes me strongly averse to conflict. I am a results oriented worker who is committed to executing tasks with meticulous diligence.</p>

            <p>Coming to my part-time tuition job, over the passage of time, it has become more of my passion than something I do to earn extra pocket money. I have learned how fulfilling it can be to make someone learn something knew. Plus I have learned patience. Explaining some algebra concept for the millionth time has bought tolerance to my normally tempestuous nature.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p >I also have responsibility for cleaning the house on weekdays and lunch and dinner on weekends. Before I started those chores, I never valued my momâ€™s seamless running of the household. Now when I have to help my mom because age has slowed her down, I realize how tough it can get for a stay-at-home mom even. By giving a helping hand, I have come to realize how seriously I view responsibility.</p>

      <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>I am just a highschool graduate schooled from Uganda. I have worked for two  years now, started from Rwanda and currently working in Kenya. I decided to take a class on programming because i am hoping to continue with block chain programming so i badly need the basic languanges.</p>
        <p>I decided to join Moringa because i belive its the best in kENYA and i wont have to waste alot of time on theory, non-productive courses and work any other IT University offers but rather more on  practicals.</p>
