    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I had never been a stellar student as a kid but am now quite a hard working student. This is because as I grew up, I realized the importance of studies and how much of their money and leisure time both my parents have sacrificed for me. While applying myself fervently to my studies in the hopes of getting a successful job and succeeding in the world, I have come to realize how hard working I actually am. If I am given a challenge, I can always rise up to it and never compromise on my studies.</p>
    <p>Coming to my part-time tuition job, over the passage of time, it has become more of my passion than something I do to earn extra pocket money. I have learned how fulfilling it can be to make someone learn something knew. Plus I have learned patience. Explaining some algebra concept for the millionth time has bought tolerance to my normally tempestuous nature.</p>
    <p>I also have responsibility for cleaning the house on weekdays and lunch and dinner on weekends. Before I started those chores, I never valued my momâ€™s seamless running of the household. Now when I have to help my mom because age has slowed her down, I realize how tough it can get for a stay-at-home mom even. By giving a helping hand, I have come to realize how seriously I view responsibility.</p>
